Make a grid of points C (imagine a tiling of eqltl triangles).
In that grid, beams go straight and cross lines as they actually reflect in reality.
We count the crossings as reflections.

In that grid, all the points on any horizontal line (y = k/2*3**.5) have the
same number of crossings. Some of them are not valid since they are a repeating
reflecting pattern.

The answer is the sequence:

The MÃ¶bius inversion of the number of partitions of n with parts of size 2 and 3.

The number of partitions is very easy:
